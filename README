Description
-----------

This is a plugin for Wordpress 3.0+ to allow for authentication to North Carolina
State University's WRAP authentication mechanism.


-------------------------
Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1:  Extract folder "ncsuwrap" into your Wordpress plugin directory, typically
    located in /wp-content/plugins
    
2:  Copy the .htaccess file distributed with the plugin into your base Wordpress
    directory.
    
3:  Log into the admin section of your Wordpress site, typically at 
    http://[yoururl]/wp-admin
    
4:  Click on "Plugins."

5:  You should have a plugin called "WRAP Authentication" in your plugin list.  
    Click the "Activate" link under it.
    
6:  If the username you logged into Wordpress with does not match your Unity ID,
    you should create yourself a user that matches and grant it admin permissions.
    You can do that by clicking the "Users" link and then the "Add New" link.  Be
    sure to give the user the role of "Administrator" otherwise your account will
    not be able to administrate your wordpress instance.
    
7:  The plugin gives you the ability to create users in Wordpress (if they don't
    already exist) when the log in with WRAP.  By default this is turned off,
    but you can change this option by going under the "Settings" link and then
    clicking on "WRAP Authentication".
    
8:  At this point, you should be ready to go.  My suggestion is to log in to your
    Wordpress admin account from another browser to test to make sure you get
    redirected to WRAP and that your account matching your Unity ID can log in
    successfully.

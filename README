Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1:  Download the package from the github page located at:
    http://github.com/jfaustin/NCSU-Wordpress-WRAP-Plugin
    
2:  Extract folder "ncsuwrap" into your Wordpress plugin directory, typically
    located in /wp-content/plugins.  If your Wordpress installation allows plugins
    to be installed via a zip file, you can do that as well by clicking on
    "Plugins" -> "Add New" -> "Upload" and upload the zip file.  NOTE:  This
    only works if you download the pre-packaged zip file from github.  If you
    download the source directly, uploading that zip file will not work correctly.
    Essentially, you need to ensure that the /wp-content/plugins/ncsuwrap directory
    exists.
    
2:  Copy the .htaccess file distributed with the plugin into your base Wordpress
    directory.
    
3:  Log into the admin section of your Wordpress site, typically at 
    http://[yoururl]/wp-admin
    
4:  Click on "Plugins."

5:  You should have a plugin called "WRAP Authentication" in your plugin list.  
    Click the "Activate" link under it.
    
6:  If the username you logged into Wordpress with does not match your Unity ID,
    you should create yourself a user that matches and grant it admin permissions.
    You can do that by clicking the "Users" link and then the "Add New" link.  Be
    sure to give the user the role of "Administrator" otherwise your account will
    not be able to administrate your wordpress instance.
    
7:  The plugin gives you the ability to create users in Wordpress (if they don't
    already exist) when they log in with WRAP.  By default this is turned off,
    but you can change this option by going under the "Settings" link and then
    clicking on "WRAP Authentication".
    
8:  At this point, you should be ready to go.  My suggestion is to log in to your
    new Wordpress unity-id-matching account from another browser to test to make 
    sure you get redirected to WRAP and that your account matching your Unity ID 
    can log in successfully.
